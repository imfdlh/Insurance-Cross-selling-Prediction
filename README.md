# Insurance-Cross-selling-Prediction

This is Sandbox 2.0 final project at Rakamin Academy Data Science Bootcamp.
We try to solve the vehicle insurance cross-selling problems using health insurance customer dataset from kaggle and their response towards the cross-selling offer.
The dataset is pre-processed as follows:
- Checking missing value/duplicated value
- Feature encoding
- Outlier treatment
- Imbalanced class treatment using SMOTE oversampling 50:50
- Split train test 7:3
- Feature scaling (standardization)
